    <h1>Brian Dean Ullery</h1>
    <p class="about-content">My name is Brian Dean Ullery. Nice to meet you! I call myself a Full Stack Web Developer,
      but I do much more than just that. I was born October 16th, 2006. I began my programming journey at 6 years old,
      but I wouldn't say I got decent until around 8. Technology has always been a fascination of mine. I
      love helping others and exploring new curiosities. I'd describe myself as a jack of all trades, because whenever
      something interests me, I learn how to participate in it. Because of this, I'm also a quick learner. I
      am a furry, and have a fursona named "PatPat", who you can find dotted around the site. I also have
      hobbies in video games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Minecraft. If there's a puzzle to solve, count me in.
      Below are some of my favorite projects I've made over the years, handpicked to show some of my many, many
      skills.<br><br>

        <p>
          <a href="https://exblue.nonzerocornet34.repl.co/">Link!</a><br>
          A year ago, I was hired onto the Ex Blue Crew as lead software engineer. In my free time, I'd work on this
          website to showcase what they'd been up to, where they were going, etc. Ex Blue Con 2023 also required a means
          of purchasing tickets, so I utilized the PayPal Rest API in order to create and verify transactions.

          <a href="https://ciap.nonzerocornet34.repl.co/">Link!</a><br>
          As a college assignment for extra credit, my professor asked me to repair a program he used to use to show
          confidence intervals.

        <p>
          <a href="https://model2desmos.nonzerocornet34.repl.co/">Link!</a><br>
          After the popular graphing calculator, Desmos, released their 3D counterpart, I created an algorithm in
          javascript that converts a .obj model to a specified number of equations that when inserted into a graph form
          up to create the full model.

          Honestly... I was just messing around. After watching an Acerola video about different ways to shade
          something, I tried creating my own filter, and stumbled upon something that reminded me of a lava lamp. It can
          take both ../images and videos, because ../images get converted to 1 frame videos.

          <a href="https://img2desmos.nonzerocornet34.repl.co/">Link!</a><br>
          Using edge detection, I was able to create an algorithm that can convert an image to a set of points, in order
          of closest to the point previous. This generates then a copiable equation, and by splitting gif frames you can
          even get animation in there.

          After developing a function that can approximate the intersections between to functions, I set out to "graph"
          the shape that is mae by two perpendicular waves, a sine and cosine wave respectively, in any phase. So, I
          simulated it in JavaScript.

          Me and my friends used to like watching Algodoo marbe races, and I wanted to try and make one in Unity rather
          than Algodoo. In about 10 minutes, I was able to create a marble race game in Unity, and embedded it in a
          webpage.

          I make lot's of music, and also I love listening to others' music. But sometimes I want to see cool visuals to
          go along with the sick beats. Noticing there wasn't already a YouTube video audio visualizer, I made one
          myself using the HTML5 canvas and JavaScript analyzer.

          I like making video games, but it's hard to do art sometimes, because I just have one monitor. So, I devised a
          plan: convert the image to a video and play picture in picture. Voila, works like a charm. Boosted my workflow
          a whole lot.

          When I was in my chemistry class, I hated having to find Molar Mass manually. So me and a friend made this
          tool to do it for us. He and I gathered data, and I made sure to make it visually pleasing while keeping it
          simple.
